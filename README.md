# Jeylabs.App

# Angular 5 CLI app

* The solution comprises of a **Graphics Service** (back end) and a **Shapes Viewer component** (UI front end)
* The Service is injected into the component.
* The user entered natural language command is passed from the UI to the Service.
* The Service 
    * parses the command using regular expressions (javascript flavor)
    * calculates the vertices (Points) on the Shape 
    * and returns a Shape with these Points.
* These points are then drawn on a 2D canvas to draw the Shape.
